# Handling forms in React Native using [Formik](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-native-formik) and [Yup](https://www.npmjs.com/package/yup).

  Forms in React/React Native can be verbose, but [Formik](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-native-formik) simplifies the three most annoying aspects:

  1. Getting values in and out of form state
  2. Validation and error messages
  3. Handling form submission
## Features
- Automatically focus on the next input
+ Convert your React Native input to Formik Field with no boilerplate
## Installation
```yarn add formik react-native-formik```

```npm i yup```
## Demo

>**Note**: Make sure you have completed the [React Native - Environment Setup](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) instructions till "Creating a new application" step, before proceeding.

## Step 1: Start the Metro Server

First, you will need to start **Metro**, the JavaScript _bundler_ that ships _with_ React Native.

To start Metro, run the following command from the _root_ of your React Native project:

```bash
# using npm
npm start

# OR using Yarn
yarn start
```

## Step 2: Start your Application

Let Metro Bundler run in its _own_ terminal. Open a _new_ terminal from the _root_ of your React Native project. Run the following command to start your _Android_ or _iOS_ app:

### For Android

```bash
# using npm
npm run android

# OR using Yarn
yarn android
```

### For iOS

```bash
# using npm
npm run ios

# OR using Yarn
yarn ios
```

If everything is set up _correctly_, you should see your new app running in your _Android Emulator_ or _iOS Simulator_ shortly provided you have set up your emulator/simulator correctly.

This is one way to run your app â€” you can also run it directly from within Android Studio and Xcode respectively.

## Congratulations! :tada:

You've successfully run and modified your React Native App. :partying_face:
