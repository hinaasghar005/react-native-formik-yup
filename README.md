# Handling forms in React Native using [Formik](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-native-formik) and [Yup](https://www.npmjs.com/package/yup).

  Forms in React/React Native can be verbose, but [Formik](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-native-formik) simplifies the three most annoying aspects:

  1. Getting values in and out of form state
  2. Validation and error messages
  3. Handling form submission
## Features
- Automatically focus on the next input
+ Convert your React Native input to Formik Field with no boilerplate
## Installation
```yarn add formik react-native-formik```

```npm i yup```
## Demo
